Introduction
============

BFilt uses cmake and make to build all its components.

DEPENDANCES
===========

You must install first :

GSL

INSTALLATION
============

Go to the bin directory :

 cd BFilt/bin

Run Cmake (>2.6) :

 cmake ../src

If you want to change the default install directory you can type
